## About the Video Course
	JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is very simple data representation format. Itâ€™s easy to read by humans, easy to parse by computers. JSON is language independent and supported by most of the modern programming languages. All of these make it one of the most popular data exchange formats.Java EE 8 fully supports JSON. It includes JSON Processing and JSON Binding APIs. These APIs were designed as part of Java Community Process by a group of experts in this area. 
This course is dedicated to JSON-P 1.1, JSON-B 1.0 and Yasson 1.0. You will learn how to use these APIs to build portable applications based on Java standards. We will start with simple use cases and step by step, increasing complicity, go to advanced features.
By the end of this course, you will become familiar with JSON Processing API and JSON Binding API. You will be able to create, parse and transform JSON documents, use JSON Pointer, JSON Patch as well as JSON-B adapters and serializers and other features
